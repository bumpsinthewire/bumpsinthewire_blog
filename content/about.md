### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex

![profile pic](/static/about/profile.jpeg)

I currently work as a Senior Network Engineer for [Presidio Federal](https://presidiofederal.com). Most of my work revolves around modernizing data center infrastructure and assisting customers as they begin their transition to a hybrid, multi-cloud footprint. 

I am a cohost of the [Cables2Clouds](https://www.cables2clouds.com) podcast.

My professional interests are currently around making hybrid, multi-cloud networking easy and consumable for any and everyone, especially through the use of automation.

In my offtime I'm usually spending time with my family, hiking in the mountains, or going on long, slow runs.
