## A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
A few years ago, I had another blog with a few pieces of content on it. One of those pieces of content went by the same title as this post, "The three paradigms of networking". I've decided to re-write that post since the old one no longer exists. I also believe that my views on this, while they haven't changed too much, have matured quite a bit and I've gained a lot more experience in the field and a bounty of knowledge that has helped shape my opinions. So, without further ado, let's get into it.

## The three paradigms
I believe that there are currently three paradigms of networking. What I mean by this is that the field of network engineering is essentially split into three areas right now. They have some similarities but I think overall they are very different and require very different skillsets. I'll go through each one and explain what I mean. Again, this is just how I currently see the field of networking, and I'm sure there are many other ways to look at it. I reserve the right to change my opinion again in the future üòÅ

### The first paradigm: The traditional on-prem network engineer
Yes, I say on-prem and not on-premises. I'm not real sure what the argument around this is but I'll be using on-prem going forward. 

This is probably where most of the readers of this post will fit in. These are the network engineers that cut their teeth mostly in the enterprise space, and most likely on some sort of [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com) gear, with a few others growing up on [Juniper](https://www.juniper.net) gear or even [Arista](https://www.arista.com/en/) gear. This type of engineer might have started in the arcane arts of "programming" a router or switch CLI to do basic things like change a hostname, or configure a port with VLANs, or add a description to it. After this they likely moved on to more advanced things like configuring routing protocols such as [OSPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First) or [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol). They might have even learned how to configure [MPLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching) and [LDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_Distribution_Protocol). Eventually, buzzwords like SDN and automation started to become more prevalent and they started to learn how to use tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) or python to automate some of their basic tasks or fact gathering. This led to operating systems like [Cumulus Linux](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-linux/) and [SONiC](https://azure.github.io/SONiC/) becoming more popular and the network engineer started to learn how to use Linux and bash to do things like configure a switch or router. Eventually everything started looking like a fabric and the network engineer started to learn how to use tools like [EVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_Virtual_Private_Network) and [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN) to build one. To be fair though, lots of vendors started putting out tools to help with this, such as [Cisco ACI](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/index.html). The point of a product like ACI is to abstract away the complexity of building a fabric and make it easier for the network engineer to operate. In the case of ACI, this can be done through a GUI but ideally it's done through an API. 

As you can see here, the real key to this paradigm is that it is encompassed by all the basic networking skills that a network engineer would learn while on their path of say, obtaining a prestigiuos certification like a CCIE. These skills will be useful pretty much throughout their whole career and will be the foundation of their knowledge. Continually building on this foundation will be key to their success.

I think one of the jobs that isn't talked about much that would fall under this paradigm is the network engineer that moves to working for a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), specifically managing the enormous underlay networks that are required for these CSPs to operate. This is a network engineer that is working for a company like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com). These engineers are still doing a lot of the same things that they would be doing in an enterprise environment, but they are doing it at a much larger scale. They are also doing it in a much more automated fashion. This work is largely invisible to the end user, but it is the backbone of the CSPs and is what allows them to operate at the scale that they do.

### The second paradigm: The cloud network engineer
